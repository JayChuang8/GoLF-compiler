# GoLF-compiler

This project is a comprehensive effort to build a compiler for a subset of the Go programming language into MIPS assembly code. The GoLF compiler includes several essential components such as a scanner, a parser that generates an abstract syntax tree (AST), a semantic checker, and a MIPS code generator. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a deep understanding of compiler construction, from lexical analysis to code generation, in the context of the Go programming language.

## Components
### 1. Scanner 

## To build the project

Go to the root directory and run make, this will iteratively run all of the makefiles within the subdirectories as well. The output will be a golf.exe (./golf).

To run the project, use: "./golf file".
