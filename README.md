## To build the project

Go to the root directory and run make, this will iteratively run all of the makefiles within the subdirectories as well. The final result will be a golf.exe (./golf).

To run the project, use: "python3 run-mips", since this compiler generates MIPS code from GoLF files. A sample run can be seen in the run.output file, where it shows the test cases.
